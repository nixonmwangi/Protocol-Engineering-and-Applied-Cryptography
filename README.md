# Protocol Engineering and Applied Cryptography
Welcome to my project-phased roadmap repository. This repo documents my journey from mathematical foundations with Python → cryptography → protocol engineering, with portfolio-ready projects in Rust, C, Solidity, and Python.

It’s structured in phases, each containing notebooks, experiments, projects, and blogs, reflecting hands-on learning and applied research.


```
The structure:
|__ environments/                  # Conda & pip environment setup and others
|
├── phase-1-foundations/           # Math + Python foundations
│   ├── notebooks/                 # Jupyter notebooks for practice & theory
│   ├── experiments/               # Test runs, prototypes, code snippets
│   ├── projects/                  # Applied projects per phase
│   └── blogs/                     # Documentation, reflections, mini-guides

# Roadmap Goals : 

1. Build strong mathematics + programming foundations + minimal artificial intelligence to build logic.

2. Implement and analyze classical & modern cryptographic algorithms.

3. Explore protocol engineering with blockchain, networking, and distributed systems.

4. Develop portfolio-grade projects to showcase applied skills.

5. Maintain a public learning log through blogs and GitHub commits.
