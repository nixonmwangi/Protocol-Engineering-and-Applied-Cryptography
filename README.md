# Protocol Engineering and Applied Cryptography
Welcome to my project-phased roadmap repository. This repo documents my journey from mathematical foundations with Python → cryptography → protocol engineering, with portfolio-ready projects in Rust, C, Solidity, and Python.

It’s structured in phases, each containing notebooks, experiments, projects, and blogs, reflecting hands-on learning and applied research.

# Roadmap Goals : 

1. Build strong mathematics + programming foundations + minimal artificial intelligence to build logic.

2. Implement and analyze classical & modern cryptographic algorithms.

3. Explore protocol engineering with blockchain, networking, and distributed systems.

4. Develop portfolio-grade projects to showcase applied skills.

5. Maintain a public learning log through blogs and GitHub commits.
   
6. Contribute to open-source projects in cryptography or protocol engineering to gain real-world collaboration  experience.
